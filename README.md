# Needs to be done
- Connect the LCD and program it; Problem is, we don't have Grove-to-Dupont cable, regular wiring doesn't fit the port
- Connect Ultrasonic Sensor and code it (basics done); Still waiting for it
- Connect USB-C port; Still waiting for it

# Good to implement
- Proper switching on/off by cutting power and not just deeming the led strip
